### Beginner
Simple Class Definition:
Create a class called Person with attributes name and age.
Add a method greet that prints a greeting message including the person’s name.
Class with Methods:
Create a class Rectangle with attributes length and width.
Add methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
Class with Constructor:
Create a class Car with attributes make, model, and year.
Add a constructor to initialize these attributes and a method to display the car’s details.
### Intermediate
Inheritance:
Create a base class Animal with a method speak.
Create subclasses Dog and Cat that inherit from Animal and override the speak method to print appropriate sounds.
Encapsulation:
Create a class BankAccount with private attributes balance and account_number.
Add methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance, ensuring that the balance cannot be accessed directly.
Polymorphism:
Create a base class Shape with a method area.
Create subclasses Circle and Square that implement the area method.
### Advanced
Abstract Classes and Interfaces:
Create an abstract class Employee with an abstract method calculate_salary.
Create subclasses FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee that implement the calculate_salary method.
Class Relationships:
Create classes Library, Book, and Member.
Implement relationships where a Library can have multiple Books and Members, and a Member can borrow Books.
Design Patterns:
Implement the Singleton pattern in a class DatabaseConnection to ensure only one instance of the connection exists.
Implement the Observer pattern with classes Subject and Observer to demonstrate a simple event notification system.

Create a new project named ClassModeling. You are given two different scenarios for which to model each of these real-world objects. Consider the important properties and methods needed for each scenario and each model and then create a Java class for each of the following:
-----------------------------
- House
Model a house as if the class were to be part of a GPS mapping system.
Model a house as if the class were to be part of a 3-D design system.
- Airplane
Model an airplane as if the class were to be part of an air traffic control system.
Model an airplane as if the class were to be part of a flight simulator.
- Car
Model a car as if the class were to be part of an inventory system for a car dealership.
Model a car as if the class were to be part of a video game.
- Ice cream
Model ice cream as if the class were to be part of the control system at the dairy that makes the ice cream.
Model ice cream as if the class were to be part of the stocking system at a grocery store.
- Book
Model a book as if the class were to be part of a publishing system that the author uses to write the book.
Model a book as if the class were to be part of a library cataloging system.
Do the following for each class:

Define properties 
Implement a constructor to initialize some or all of the property values.
Determine what behaviors the class should have and then define (do not implement) the methods associated with each behavior.
Be prepared to explain the reasons behind all of your design decisions.
