### Create a React app using next.js

1. First, install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
```
npm install react react-dom next


1. Create a new file called `pages/index.js` and add the following code to it:
```
import React from 'react';
import { NextPage } from 'next';

const IndexPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default IndexPage;
```
This code defines a new React component called `IndexPage` that renders an `<h1>` element with the text "Welcome to my app!"
3. Create a new file called `pages/about.js` and add the following code to it:
```
import React from 'react';
import { NextPage } from 'next';

const AboutPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>This is an about page.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AboutPage;
```
This code defines a new React component called `AboutPage` that renders an `<h1>` element with the text "About" and a paragraph of text.
4. Create a new file called `pages/contact.js` and add the following code to it:
```
import React from 'react';
import { NextPage } from 'next';

const ContactPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Contact</h1>
      <p>This is a contact page.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ContactPage;
```
This code defines a new React component called `ContactPage` that renders an `<h1>` element with the text "Contact" and a paragraph of text.
5. Create a new file called `pages/404.js` and add the following code to it:
```
import React from 'react';
import { NextPage } from 'next';

const NotFoundPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Not Found</h1>
      <p>This page could not be found.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default NotFoundPage;
```
This code defines a new React component called `NotFoundPage` that renders an `<h1>` element with the text "Not Found" and a paragraph of text.
6. Create a new file called `pages/_app.js` and add the following code to it:
```
import { NextApp } from 'next';

const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyApp;
```
This code defines a new React component called `MyApp` that renders an `<h1>` element with the text "My App" and a list of links to the other pages in your app.
7. Finally, create a new file called `next.config.js` and add the following code to it:
```
module.exports = {
  target: 'serverless',
};
```
This code configures Next.js to use the serverless target, which allows you to deploy your app to a cloud provider like AWS or Google Cloud without having to manage a server.
8. Now that you've set up your project, you can run the following command in your terminal to start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```
This will start the development server and open your app in your default web browser. You can make changes to your code and see them reflected in your app without having to restart the server.
9. When you're ready to deploy your app, you can use the following command to build a static version of your app:
```
npm run build
```
This will create a `build` directory in your project root that contains all the files needed to run your app. You can then upload these files to a cloud provider like AWS or Google Cloud and configure your serverless function to serve them.

That's it! With these steps, you should now have a basic React app using Next.js set up and running on your local machine. From here,
